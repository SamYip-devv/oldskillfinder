As the mystery unfolds, the film offers a haunting portrayal of migrant workers' lives and reveals the exploitative dynamics underneath such large-scale infrastructure development.\n\nAfter the screening, invited speakers will share insights on ecocriticism from a cultural studies perspective, using the film as an entry point. We will then open the floor to students for more conversation on the socio-environmental ramifications of land reclamation—exploring its impact on social life, its entanglement with the exploitation of peripheral economies, and its role in reshaping ecological and social balances.",
